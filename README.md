Question: Data Visualization using Python.
Dataset: titanic.csv
1. Load the Titanic dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Explore the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
3. Calculate and visualise the basic statistics (mean, median, etc) for the numeric columns
4. Create a bar chart to show the distribution of passengers by class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
5. Create a histogram to visualise the age distribution of passengers.
6. Calculate and visualise the survival rate of passengers. Create a pie chart to represent this information
7. Create a bar chart to show the count of passengers by gender.
8. Create a stacked bar chart to visualise the survival rate by gender.
9. Create a count plot (bar chart) to show the number of passengers who embarked from each location (S, C, Q). What do you notice about the embarkation points?
10. Create a box plot to visualise the distribution of family sizes among passengers.
11. Create a scatter plot to visualise the relationship between fare and age.
